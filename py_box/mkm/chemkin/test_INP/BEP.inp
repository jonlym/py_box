! BEP #, BEP Type, m, b, decomposition/synthesis, mean/std dev uncertainty
!   BEP Type: -1/0/1 is TSS IS/BEP/TSS FS
!   m/b defined by
!     -1: (ETS)=m(EIS)+b 
!      0: (Ea)=m(deltaHrxn)+b
!      1: (ETS)=m(EFS)+b 
!     All intercepts are in kcal/mol and EIS, EFS, ETS are the heats of
!       formation of the species (/NOT/ the binding energies)
!   decomposition/synthesis reference direction denoted by -1/1
!   If uncertainty values not needed, can use zeros as dummy entries

!Specify BEP number and reaction direction for all reactions below.
!The BEP number is given above (enter 0 if BEP should not be used for
!this reaction). The reaction direction is one of -1/1 for
!decomposition/synthesis. If BEPs are not used, then the reaction
!direction does not need to be specified (use 0 as a dummy value).
!Only those reactions using BEPs need to be specified. This is done
!via the reaction string in the third column. This reaction string must
!/exactly/ match the reaction string in surf.out (aside from the line break
!and writing repeated species with a summed stoichiometric coefficient);
!any deviation is a fatal error which will terminate the program. The first
!line following the comments should be the total number of reactions using
!BEP correlations.
