!This file is for specifying granular tolerances for each species/equation in
!the system. The format is alternating columns of absolute and relative
!tolerances with one pair of columns for each run in the MultiInput sequence.
!If granular tolerances are not desired (e.g., for a first run), set ltol=F in
!tube.inp and set the abstol and reltol values to the desired values. The
!first column should be of the format 'name/phase/' (quotes and slashes required)
!where name is the species name and phase is the phase name.
2  !Number of non-default entries
T  !Is the energy balance affected? If so, put it last with a dummy string at the start.
